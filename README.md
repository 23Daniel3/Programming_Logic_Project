# Programming_Logic_Project
This project consists of a remote-controlled car using two ESP32 microcontrollers â€” one acting as the controller and the other as the car unit responsible for driving the motors.

The controller ESP32 includes:

A display that shows the selected route

Four buttons to choose between predefined routes

A fifth button to start the car

Once a route is selected and the start button is pressed, the car ESP32 receives the command via wireless communication (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) and moves according to the chosen path.

This project aims to demonstrate concepts of:

Embedded systems

Wireless communication between microcontrollers

Logical control and route selection

Integration of hardware and software using ESP32
